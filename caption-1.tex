\caption{Representations of the complete directed graph $K_3$, where there is an edge $u\rightarrow v$ for each directed pair of the $3$ vertices $u,v \in \{A,B,C\}$. As can be seen (left), the graph is composed from $6$ trivial cycles: 3 single-arrow cycles (e.g., $\pair AA$), and 3 double-arrow cycles (e.g., $\pair AB$). The corresponding cycle matrix is shown top right. The cycles represented by it are shown explicitly in the larger matrix (bottom right), which has one entry shown explicitly for each trivial cycle. The omitted entries in the matrix are implied by symmetry, as, for example, the top right would be $\pair AC$ but this is the same cycle as $\pair CA$, which is shown bottom left.}
