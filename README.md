# relit
Reverse literate programming tool **relit** plus demonstration of a nice, short Euler cycle algorithm useful for planning sequential experiments.

* Read `eulerpaper.pdf` to see what it is all about.

* Run `make` 
  (or `make all`) to generate all the various files. You can then run the programs or typeset the paper `eulerpaper.tex`

* Run `make man` 
  to get the manual for relit.

* Run `make clean` 
  to tidyup.
