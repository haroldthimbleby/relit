\caption{Comparing various ways to write about programming. Note that in the conventional approach (a) there is no guarantee that the published paper faithfully represents the source code, as the paper and source code can be (and will be) edited independently: what is published has no automatic connection to the source code. (Although not made clear in the diagram, typically source code and \LaTeX\ documents will be split into multiple files for convenience. All methods can handle multiple files.)}
