# Version 1.0
#
# when you use make for latex/bibtex/makeindex make gets confused with circular dependencies
# 
# Use: helpMake files[-target]... "command arguments > etc"
#
# Meaning: when you run the command, the target file(s) should be created
# So in a makefile you might say
#
# doc.aux-target: doc.tex doc.bbl
#	helpMake doc.aux "latex doc.tex"
#
# doc.bbl-target: doc.aux
#	helpMake doc.bbl "bibtex doc.aux"
#
# HOW IT WORKS
# file and file-target are the same files, using them avoids make spotting circular dependencies
# but the files are only updated if running the command changes their contents. 
# file-target gets updated so make is happy for this rule
# but file (if its contents did not change) is not updated, so other rules depending on it do not file
# moreover, because file and file-target are the same file, 
# but make does not realise, the circular dependencies are broken
# .... will create temporary files *-temp-$$ (and will remove them if it runs to completion)
