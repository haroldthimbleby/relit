\caption{The more code that is hidden, the more likely it will drift into complexity and concealed critical details. Conventional literate programming hides nothing, but typically makes the result too large to be publishable (\name{JavaDoc} only documents the API rather than the entire program). \name{Loom} and \name{Warp} help ensure code published is correct, but it may be incomplete. The present paper's reverse approach, as embodied by \name{relit}, ensures almost all the code is published, and what the authors may choose not to publish can easily be checked with simple diagnostics (see section~\ref{complete-program}) --- and what is not published remains in the original \LaTeX\ files, so the authors always remain aware of it.}
